# Project Overview

## Title
AgriDrone Optimization — scaled demonstration sprayer

## Team
- Mechanical / CAD: [Your Name] (remote)
- Electronics & Simulation: assisted (AI templates + guidance)
- Notes: Project demonstrates remote-ready digital twin + simulations.

## Objective
Deliver a manufacturable small-scale spray drone demonstrator that:
- Achieves 30–100 L/ha adjustable flow,
- Produces droplets 0.5–2.5 mm,
- Achieves ≥85% uniformity in the target swath,
- Keeps drift ≤5 m at wind ≤5 m/s (via nozzle/parameter tuning).

## Deliverables (Module A)
- SolidWorks assembly (.STEP) + 2 production drawings (.PDF)
- BOM CSV with part numbers and prices
- KiCAD schematic (pump driver + sensor + RC kill-switch)
- 1-page technical description (purpose, constraints, major choices)
