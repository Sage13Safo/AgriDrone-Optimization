## 4. Speaking Script  

### 🎬 Opening (30s)
> “Good day everyone, I’m Sage13 Safo, and this is my project *AgriDrone Optimization*.  
It focuses on improving spray efficiency and reducing chemical waste in precision agriculture through a computationally validated nozzle design.”

### 🧩 Design & Justification (45s)
> “I began with a parametric design of three nozzle variants — 0.5 mm, 1.5 mm, and 2.5 mm.  
After evaluating performance targets, a 2.13 mm orifice diameter was selected for optimal balance between flow rate and droplet stability.”

### 🌬️ CFD & Python Validation (60s)
> “The SolidWorks Flow Simulation demonstrated stable internal velocity and low-pressure loss at the exit.  
Python validation confirmed the theoretical flow rate of 2.7 L/min and droplet fall trajectory consistent with CFD predictions.”

### 💰 Economic Impact (45s)
> “Economically, this system offers an ROI exceeding 600% within the first operational year for medium-scale farms,  
making it a sustainable and scalable investment for precision agriculture operations.”

### 🚀 Future Work & Conclusion (30s)
> “In future, I aim to integrate real-time sensor feedback for adaptive spray control.  
This will make agricultural UAVs smarter, faster, and more efficient.”
